# Unit 4 - Personal Narrative

## Introduction

Images are often used to portray our personal experiences and interests. We also use image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of an image. When combined into collages and presentations, these images tell a story about who we are and what is important to us. Your goal is to create a personal narrative using The Theater that consists of images of your personal experiences and/or interests, incorporates data related to these experiences and/or interests that can be organized in a 2D array, and uses image filters and effects to change or enhance the mood of your images.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, two-dimensional (2D) arrays, and algorithms to create your personal narrative collage or animation:

- **Create at least two 2D arrays** – Create at least two 2D arrays to store the data that will make up your visualization.
- **Implement one or more algorithms** – Implement one or more algorithms that use loops and two-way or multi-selection statements with compound Boolean expressions to analyze the data.
- **Use Image Filters** - Include multiple image filters learned from this unit, and additionally create new ones of your own.
- **Use methods in the String class** – Use one or more methods in the String class in your program, such as to determine whether the name of an image file contains specific characters.
- **Create a visualization** – Create an image or animation that conveys the story of the data by illustrating the patterns or relationships in the data.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## Story Description

The College Tour animation is based on the universities I’ve visited in different places. It shows schools like Stanford, Yale, Princeton, and Harvard, with details about each one. The ratings are based on my personal favorites—how much I liked the campus, the atmosphere, and the overall experience. Some schools stood out more than others, and this animation reflects my journey and how I would rank them based on what I liked the most.
## Image Filter Analysis

In my animation, I used the invert colors and grayscale filters to modify the images. The invert colors filter changes each pixel by subtracting its red, green, and blue (RGB) values from 255, creating a negative effect. For example, if a pixel is originally (100, 150, 200), it becomes (155, 105, 55). The grayscale filter averages the RGB values of each pixel to create a black-and-white effect. This makes the image look more neutral and removes color details. These filters help make the animation more visually interesting by changing how the images look in different scenes.
